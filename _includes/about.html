    <h3 class="mb2">About me</h3>
    <p>
      Welcome! As someone with many interests, I enjoy coding, playing classical and jazz piano, photography, martial arts, tennis, snowboarding, and skiing.
      <br />
      <br />
      Professionally, I'm a mechanical and aerospace engineer who made the transition to systems and software engineering.
      During my roles as a flight loads engineer and structures engineer, I taught myself and applied programming and data science to my work.
      Starting with tools development to automate tasks and analysis at work, I quickly was able to lead development and create methodologies for high priority projects.
      I also concurrently worked as a simulation developer towards the end of my role as a structures engineer.
      I realized my favorite part of the job was creating tools that made people's work faster and easier with more functionality.
      <br />
      <br />
      When I became a systems/software engineer, I worked on a backend cloud development effort and eventually became scrum master of the integration team.
      I worked with other teams, leadership, and customers to drive success. I also supported AI R&D outside of my main responsibilities. 
      In the 5+ years I had in the aerospace industry at a few of the major companies, I was glad to have worked on exciting and challenging problems.
      Often limited by the environment and tools available, it is rewarding to see what can be achieved with so many constraints.
      Currently, I am at an AI accelerator startup working on user-facing software, and am very excited for the future ahead!

      Outside of work, I have my own <a href="{{ site.nav.main.projects }}">projects</a> that focus on computer vision and music AI.
